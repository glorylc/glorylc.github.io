Hello! I am currently a doctoral student from School of Mathematical Sciences, [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof.Heng Mao](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/maoh/index.html). I got my B.Eng degree in Sept. 2019, from Department of Optoelectronic Science and Technology, [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/). 

I have an undergraduate background in optoelectronic instruments and received extensive training in constructing optical imaging instruments during my Ph.D research. Additionally, my studies in the mathematics department has enhanced my ability to solve interdisciplinary problems using computational imaging techniques. Currently, I focus on breaking imaging limitations in biomedical imaging through advanced optical and mathematical computation approaches.

I am expected to recieve my Ph.D degree on <strong>July 2025</strong>, assuming everything goes smoothly. I am currently seeking suitable <strong>postdoctoral</strong> research opportunities or other <strong>opening positions</strong>. Feel free to shoot me an email if you are interested in collaborating with me.

Research Projects

During my Ph.D. research, I am the primary student responsible for several research projects. And my work and contributions are as follows:

Computational Imaging in Label-free and Fluorescence Microscopy
------
In order to address the problems of time-consuming scanning and throughput limitation in the cell microarray, I developed a high-throughput and high-content array screening imaging system. By customizing an ultra-high throughput objective lens, it achieved more than four times the imaging throughput of commercial high-throughput objective lenses. And I further improved the imaging throughput by utilizing Fourier ptychography microscopy (FPM). In addition, I have developed a structured illumination super-resolution imaging modality (SIM) based on the system. The whole system achieves both label-free and fluorescence modalities for living cells and tissue samples, allowing for comprehensive study of their structures and functions. This work has been published, <strong>Liang Chen</strong>, et al., <i>Optics and Lasers in Engineering</i>, [doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optlaseng.2024.108055](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optlaseng.2024.108055).

Lightsheet Microscopy in Zebrafish Brain Imaging
------
Single-photon light-sheet microscopy is currently the primary method used for whole brain functional studies in zebrafish. However, the wavelength used for illumination can activate optic neurons and their downstream circuits, leading to potential artificial results during functional imaging of the entire brain. The wavelength used in two-photon microscopy can avoid the visually sensitive band of zebrafish, making two-photon light-sheet microscopy ideal for whole brain imaging. However, it currently faces significant challenges. 

On the one hand, to address the lack of functional probes, I have established a two-photon screening platform (see the next section). On the other hand, to achieve high-resolution deep two-photon light-sheet imaging, I have developed a zebrafish whole-brain functional imaging system based on adaptive optical detection and correction elements. This work has been applied for Chinese Invention Patent (No. 202410709063.8).

A Two-photon Screening Platform for Fluorescent Protein
------
At present, fluorescent protein screening primarily focuses on single-photon probes, and there are no commercial high-throughput screening systems specifically designed for two-photon fluorescent proteins. I have established a complete screening platform and expect to obtain functional calcium probes with high brightness, large absorption cross-section, matching laser peak power, high fluorescence excitation efficiency and strong anti-bleaching ability.

I designed a platform that combines large field of view (FOV) stitching for macroscopic imaging and multi-site two-photon microscopic imaging, enabling high-throughput screening of proteins. Further, utilizling the screened probe, functional imaging of the whole zebrafish brain can be achieved without artificial activation by excitation wavelength.

Adaptive Optics (AO) in Microscopy 
------
I have been developing a novel optical and reconstruction method to reduce the impact of scatter in deep tissue imaging. Recently, I have built a proof-of-principle AO system to validate my idea. At the same time, utilizing a self-built wavefront sensor and deformable mirrors (from Boston and Alpao), I implemented a series of advanced techniques in AO for microscopy.
